# Second Draft- Looking specifically for install dates for CS5.5 and CS6.
#
# First the script looks for the com.Adobe.Common CS6.plist file, if found, it will pull the creation date from the file.
# If the file is not found, it will pull the creation date from the Application, Adobe Extension Manager CS6.
# It was found that the plist was not always present in all user folders, so we are using the Application date as a fallback.
# This plist and application were chosen because they are included in all installs of CS and because they can be used to easily distinguish between version 5.5 and 6.
# Both variables can be changed at the beginning of the script.
